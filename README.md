Question 2 of Assignment 2

"For the in-class Activity 7 you added to the Caldera architecture the MVC components required for the user to interact with the system. In this programming assignment you will program an MVC architectural design following an Observer pattern so that the View can receive the notifications from the updated Model. 

Implement the MVC architecture on the provided assignment Java Classes leveraging the Observer Java Class so that the StoreView is updated when customers are added to the Store through the StoreController. Submit the code and screen dumps of the test program showing that the Customers are printed out every time that they are updated. 

Demonstrate the flexibility of the pattern by adding a new graphical output rather than the text output. The only Class that should be updated is the StoreView Class."
